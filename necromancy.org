** What is Software Necromancy?

(Grand Lodge of BC and Yukon, from /Venture Brothers/ S1 E12)

Not to be confused with Software Necrophilia.

Aw, c'mon, who am I kidding?
** Starts out simply enough...
A little nostalgia for the machines of one's youth...

** But these things are a little inconvenient
I still have my childhood Apple //e; most people don't.

Fortunately Moore's Law makes faster-than-original speed emulation of
these systems quite easy.

** But then your desires get...more exotic
  + [[https://www.mamedev.org/][MAME/MESS]] The arcade emulator, has absorbed MESS and has a
    surprisingly good non-arcade cabinet selection not merely of 8-bit home
    computers but all sorts of things.  Very graphical/console oriented.
  + [[http://simh.trailing-edge.com][SIMH]] Mostly but not entirely DEC, from PDP-1 to VAX.  Excellent
    non-graphical choice, and much better for remote text-mode access to
    machines.
  + [[http://www.hercules-390.eu/][Hercules]] IBM 360/370/390/System z emulation.  Fragmented development
    now, quite confusing, maybe stalled, but for historical emulation v3
    works just fine.

** Or you can go in more recent directions

*** Working pretty well
  +  [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/previous/][Previous]] emulates a NextStation
  +  [[https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox][AXPBox]] is an Alpha emulator.
  +  [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] can do Sparc Sun machines and IBM pSeries PowerPCs.

*** Need some work

  +  It looks like [[http://www.unlambda.com/index.php?n=Main.Cadr][CADR, the LISP Machine emulator]] has bitrotted.
  +  So has [[https://people.csail.mit.edu/fredette/tme/index.html][TME (for 68K Sun3 machines)]] 

With a little elbow grease, either might be resurrectable.

Plenty of other things out there too; these are just the ones I've been
poking at.

** But isn't that hardware emulation?

Where's the software necromancy part?

Well, you need to run /something/ on these computers, don't you?

Let's start with the operating system.

** What might you run?

*** DEC
**** PDP-8 
OS/8, and its various languages: Assembly, BASIC, FORTRAN

**** PDP-11
RT-11, RSX-11, RSTS...and the Research Unixes

**** VAX
***** VMS
SIMH VAX runs VMS/OpenVMS up to 7.3, although you can't get a new
license anymore and your HP Hobbyist License for VAX runs out on July 1
at the latest.

***** Unix
4.3BSD, or indeed current NetBSD 9.1

*** A bit more about VMS
You can either growl "arrr, matey" and search for
PAKGEN.C, or you can ask [[https://vmssoftware.com/][VMS Software]] for a hobbyist license for Alpha,
which runs perfectly well on AXPBox.

The amd64 port may be available for general-audience early adopters
this year.  I also made some inquiries about arm64...

*** IBM
**** S/360
OS/MFT, OS/MVT, DOS

**** S/370
MVS, VM, DOS/VS, and some weirder options like TSS, MTS, and MUSIC

Newer than MVS 3.8J. DOS/VS r34, or VM/370 r6, there be very scary
copyright dragons.

** Unix For Life

There are easy-to-follow how-to guides for SIMH: PDP-7 Unix ("v0"),
v1-kernel-with-v2 userland, v5, v6, and v7.  As well as the
might-as-well-be-modern 2.11BSD (indeed, still actively developed).

I wrote a blog post [[https://athornton.dreamwidth.org/14340.html][exploring this]] a couple years ago.

[[https://www.tuhs.org/][The Unix Heritage Society (TUHS)]] is an excellent, and friendly, resource.

It's surprisingly easy to get something that boots.


...maybe a little /too/ easy.

** When one's tastes become more outr√©

Multiple [[https://github.com/PDP-10/klh10][PDP-10]] emulators allow you to run not only late versions of
TOPS-20 but also ITS.  (TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 up to v4 run fine in SIMH.)
The KA-10 and the KL-10 are quite different machines.

[[https://github.com/charlesUnixPro/dps8m][DPS8M]] enables the use of Multics.

Multics is, of course, interesting as a Unix precursor; all of these
together give you what you need for a critical reevaluation of
[[https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf][The UNIX- HATERS Handbook]].  Spoiler: I don't agree with ESR about much,
but he's right about /this/.

I have [[https://athornton.dreamwidth.org/14272.html][taken the liberty]].

** What resources does all this emulation take?

You can visit https://mvsevm.fsf.net, and I am happy to create accounts
for people if playing around with the guest account is too limiting.

[[./assets/mvsevm.png]]

(me)

*** Hardware

The first four entries are 36-bit systems (three PDP-10s and a
Honeywell 6800) and run on a single Raspberry Pi 3B+ running 64-bit
Ubuntu.

The Alpha is on an 11-year-old laptop (a Lenovo T410), which was a
hand-me-down to me.

The last five entries--two VAXen and three PDP-11s--run on another
Raspberry Pi 3B+, this one running 32-bit Raspbian.

*** Software, money, power, and time

You don't want to run emulators on a host with a narrower word size than
the guest if you can avoid it.  Hence 64-bit Ubuntu for the things
emulating 36-bit wordsizes.

A Raspberry Pi is too slow for the Alpha emulator to be usable.

Total budget, maybe $100, maybe 50W, and some time (doing it from the
cookbooks, sequentially, maybe a dozen hours, most of which is spent in
disk wait).

** But now what?

There are two directions we can explore from here.  

The first is simply, how did I build https://mvsevm.fsf.net?

That's quick and easy to discuss and we will cover it today.

[[./assets/tmenu_go.png]]

(me)

** OK, and /then/ what?

Second: now that we have raised the zombies from the grave, how can we
put them to work?  What applications do we want to run on the OSes we
are now able to boot?

We don't have time for both topics in a single talk.  I'll adress the
first today and the second at a future date.

** Remember the humble terminal server?

Think back to the early 1990s, just before TCP/IP won.  You'd dial in to
a modem bank somewhere, and be confronted with a prompt, at which you'd
type the name of the system you wanted to connect to, and be connected
through some sort of serial multiplexer to it.

I wanted that, but with a web front-end.  I wrote it in Go (just because
I've missed working in Go) and called it "tmenu".

** Design Considerations

It needed to be easy to change the target systems.  I would need to
support, at a minimum:

  + telnet-to-emulated-serial-port-exposed as TCP (the standard SIMH
    method of connection)
  + telnet-to-a-TCP-port (for those more modern systems with a TCP/IP
    stack)
  + ssh-to-a-TCP-port (VMS and NetBSD, anyway, support SSH, although
    it's too slow to be usable under emulation on a Raspberry Pi, as it
    turns out).

** Target definitions file for tmenu

It's just JSON; read through it, assign a number, and map that to a
connection method:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {"name": "ITS (PDP-10 KA-10)",
   "host": "36bitpi.fsf.net",
   "handler": "telnet",
   "port": 10569
  },
  {"name": "OpenVMS 8.4 (Alpha ES40)",
   "host": "emualpha.fsf.net",
   "handler": "telnet",
   "port": 23
  },
  {"name": "Unix 4.3bsd Quasijarus (MicroVAX 3900)",
   "host": "quasijarus.fsf.net",
   "handler": "telnet",
   "port": 23
  }
#+END_SRC

** There's not much to it

[[https://github.com/athornton/tmenu][tmenu]] is my work; then I used [[https://github.com/athornton/gotty][gotty]] to put a web front-end on it.  I
point to my fork of gotty since the original is apparently abandoned.

A simple reverse proxy config in your web server (you do need to enable
websocket support), a systemd unit file (sigh), and you're done.

** Future plans: IBM mainframes

You may have noticed that although I talked about Hercules, nothing
available at https://mvsevm.fsf.net runs on S/360-or-subsequent
architectures.  I am running an MVS 3.8j and a VM/370 system--but not
through mvsevm.

This is, in a nutshell, because IBM mainframes used a 3270 terminal to
provide a cursor-addressible environment, and 3270 emulators are less
ubiquitous than ANSI ASCII terminal emulators.

** Bringing 3270 emulation to the Web

There's no good 3270 terminal emulation accessible from the web anymore.
There's the badly bitrotted [[http://h3270.sourceforge.net/][h3270]] (it may have always been this awful)
or you can try to hook up [[http://x3270.bgp.nu/][c3270]], but it doesn't play well with [[https://github.com/xtermjs][xtermjs]].

However, there is [[https://github.com/mflorence99/el-3270][el3270]], which is an Electron app.  My goal is to take
its screen model and modify it into a React web app.
